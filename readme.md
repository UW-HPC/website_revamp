This draft is built using the [Material for mkdocs theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). I chose this because it was easy, fast to get up and running, and installs as a python package.

1. Install mkdocs-material: `pip install mkdocs-material`
2. Clone this repo
3. From the root of the repo, run `mkdocs serve`
