# Hyak Prerequisites

Before you can use Hyak, you must meet a few preerequisites related to using the command line. Hyak doesn't have a graphical user interface with windows and a mouse like your personal computer does. Instead, you interact with Hyak via a 'shell'. Every action you take on Hyak will be entered to this shell as a text command. If you have used a linux system before, this is likely familiar to you. If not, it is fast to learn!

## Getting a terminal on your local computer

You will need a terminal application on your computer to access Hyak. If you use a mac or run linux, you already have this. If you use Windows, you will need to install it. We reccomend using Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL2) for this. This is a service that lets you run a full linux system on windows and gives you access to many of the tools you will need to access Hyak. Follow the instructions at [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/]https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/ to install.

## Asesssment

To gain access to Hyak, you will need to demonstrate your *nix basics proficiency by passing the skills assessment. Access this assessment at [] (UW NetID required). You must get the questions 100% correct, but you will get real-time feedback and can submit as many times as you need. If you are struggling to pass this assessment, consider coming to [link to office hour page] office hours to get help.
