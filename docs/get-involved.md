# How to get involved with RCC

**Information interview:**

Set up a recorded, short information interview to briefly discuss your project, share insights on supercomputing, and highlight how Hyak has supported your work. There is a chance that a part of the interview will be featured on the homepage of Hyak website as a spotlight! If you are interested in this option, please send an email to help@uw.edu with "Hyak student interview" in the subject line.

**Office hours:** 

As an experienced user, you can co-lead the data science office hour on HPC to provide specialized support to the community. In person office hours are held weekly. See the UW-IT Research Computing Calendar(link to https://calendar.washington.edu/sea_uwit-rc) to find upcoming office hours. You can select "HPC Office Hours - In Person" or "Research Computing Club Office Hour - In person." Let us know if you plan to attend.

**Tutorial on Hyak documentation:** 

Contribute to a short tutorial or write a blog post about a specific topic of your expertise. [The link for the Hyak website can be found here](https://hyak.uw.edu/).The Hyak team has prepared a [Contributions Guide](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/contribute/pull-request) and GitHub Codespace for the documentation website that make preparing a pull request simple. If you would like to speak to someone on the Hyak team about your tutorial idea before getting started, email help@uw.edu with "Hyak tutorial idea" in the subject line.
