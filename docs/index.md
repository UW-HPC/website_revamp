# About Research Computing Club

Research Computing Club at the University of Washington is a registered student organization that exists to support student computational research. RCC uses funding provided by the UW Student Technology Fee (STF) to maintain nodes on UW's Hyak high performance computing cluster and to provide cloud credits for student use. RCC also works with partners to provide training and support for users of these resources.

## Resources

RCC makes high performance computing resources available in the form of high performance computing cluster access and a cloud credit program. We maintain a large account on [[Hyak]](https://hyak.uw.edu/), UW's HPC cluster. This account provides access to CPU and GPU nodes. Our cloud credit program gives students additional flexibility in selecting compute resources.
