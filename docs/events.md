## Hyak Trainings

**Hyak: Open OnDemand**

Open OnDemand (OOD) is an open-source web portal for HPC centers to provide users with an easy-to-use web interface to HPC clusters. For the last year, the Hyak team has been adding features to OOD.

This workshop will demonstrate OOD's main features such as exploring the filesystem, composing jobs, and launching interactive applications like Jupyter. **_This workshop will be held in person 10am - 11:30am on Friday January, 31, 2025 in CSE2 (Gates Center) Room 371 (3800 E Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98195)._**
