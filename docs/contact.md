# Contact

## Slack
The [RCC Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/uw-rcc/shared_invite/zt-2l7ab48ar-S_SbfLiCsdpF~ofbCR0yIg) should be used as the main point of contact to get help with RCC-related things. If your question does not involve your personal information, it should probably be asked in slack first. 

## Email
The official RCC email is [hpcc@uw.edu](mailto:hpcc@uw.edu). Use this email for things that can't be asked publicly in slack, such as matters of personal eligibility.

## If all else fails
If you do not get a timely response from hpcc@uw.edu, you can ping individual officers on slack. Please consider the urgency of your request when resorting to this and respect that officers are busy students managing RCC on a volunteer basis.
