# Contact

## Slack

The [[RCC Slack workspace]](https://join.slack.com/t/uw-rcc/shared_invite/zt-2l7ab48ar-S_SbfLiCsdpF~ofbCR0yIg) should be used as the main point of contact to get help with RCC-related things. If your question does not involve your personal information, it should probably be asked in slack first.

## Email

The official RCC email is [hpcc@uw.edu](mailto:hpcc@uw.edu). Use this email for things that can't be asked publicly in slack, such as matters of personal eligibility.

## If all else fails

If you do not get a timely response from <hpcc@uw.edu>, you can ping individual officers on slack. Please consider the urgency of your request when resorting to this and respect that officers are busy students managing RCC on a volunteer basis.

## Get Involved

Reach out to the [[RCC officers]](https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/people/) if you are interested in volunteering or becoming more involved with RCC.
